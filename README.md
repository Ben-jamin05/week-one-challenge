# Week One Challenge

## Description

My motivation for refactoring this project was to fix the errors in the websites functionality, add alt text to the images for better accessability and change the HTML elements to be in Semantic structure. I solved all of these problems and learned more about how class and id attributes work in with HTML and what they can do, example being the links taking you to a different part of the page. 

## Installation

You can either just go to the website from the Github repository or via this [link](https://ben-jamin05.github.io/week-one-challenge/) or clone the code from the repository. 

## Usage

Once you have navigated to the website you should be met with a page that looks like this. You can click one of the three options at the top to navigate to those sections of the website or you can scroll down to find them.
